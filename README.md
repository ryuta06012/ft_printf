# ft_printf
Implement the same behavior as printf\n
• The prototype of ft_printf should be int ft_printf(const char *, ...);\n
• You have to recode the libc’s printf function
• It must not do the buffer management like the real printf
• It will manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
• It will manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.*’ and minimum field
width with all conversions
• It will be compared with the real printf
• You must use the command ar to create your librairy, using the command libtool
is forbidden.
